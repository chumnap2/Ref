# App Plugin

GDS App Plugins allow users to extend the functionality of the F Prime Ground Data System by running custom Python applications in a separate process. These plugins are launched and managed by the GDS infrastructure and can be used to integrate new behaviors, data processors, UIs, or bridges to external systems.

Each GDS App runs independently and a may communicate with the rest of the GDS through inter-process communication. This separation helps isolate potentially blocking or experimental functionality from core GDS processes.

An example [`OpenMCT`](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-openmct/blob/devel/src/fprime_openmct/launch_plugin.py) shows how to use a GDS App plugin to launch another service (in this case `fprime-openmct-launch`, which is a script provided by the package).

GDS Apps are `FEATURE` plugins.  All will run unless individually disabled by the user.


## Usage

GDS App Plugins are used to build custom applications that run alongside the GDS. These may include:

- Custom dashboards or telemetry visualizers
- Background processors for specific telemetry or event types
- External data bridges (e.g., logging to a database, forwarding to a network endpoint)

The plugin must define a subclass of `GdsApp` and be decorated with `@gds_plugin(GdsApp)`.

## Considerations

- GDS App Plugins are launched in separate processes by the GDS framework.
- Improper plugin behavior (e.g., crashes or blocking) won't directly impact the core GDS, but may result in lost functionality or data.
- The plugin is responsible for managing its own I/O and shutdown behavior.
- Output from the plugin is not redirected or captured by GDS unless explicitly implemented.

## Required Interface

To create a custom App Plugin, subclass the [`GdsApp`](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-gds/blob/devel/src/fprime_gds/executables/apps.py#L76) class and implement the `get_process_invocation()` method. This method returns a list of command-line arguments that will be used by GDS to launch your app as a separate process.

The process is started using `subprocess.Popen()`, so the returned list must represent a valid system command.

```python
from fprime_gds.executables.apps import GdsApp
from fprime_gds.common.plugins import gds_plugin

@gds_plugin(GdsApp)
class CustomAppPlugin(GdsApp):
    """Launches a custom Python script as a separate process."""

    def get_process_invocation(self) -> list[str]:
        return ["python3", "my_custom_app.py", "--verbose"]
```

This will cause the GDS to launch my_custom_app.py as a standalone process when the system starts. Any output or behavior of the script is entirely handled within that process and is not managed by the GDS unless your script implements its own communication mechanisms (e.g., sockets, files, etc.).

> [!NOTE]
> You are responsible for ensuring that your command works in the deployed environment and that any required files or dependencies are present.


# App Plugin

GDS App Plugins allow users to extend the functionality of the F Prime Ground Data System by running custom Python applications in a separate process. These plugins are launched and managed by the GDS infrastructure and can be used to integrate new behaviors, data processors, UIs, or bridges to external systems.

Each GDS App runs independently and communicates with the rest of the GDS through inter-process communication. This separation helps isolate potentially blocking or experimental functionality from core GDS processes.

## Usage

GDS App Plugins are used to build custom applications that run alongside the GDS. These may include:

- Custom dashboards or telemetry visualizers
- Background processors for specific telemetry or event types
- External data bridges (e.g., logging to a database, forwarding to a network endpoint)

The plugin must define a subclass of `GdsApp` or use the convenience subclass `GdsStandardApp`, and be decorated with `@gds_plugin(GdsApp)`.

## Considerations

- GDS App Plugins are launched in separate processes by the GDS framework.
- Misbehaving plugins may impact system monitoring if they crash, exit early, or consume excessive resources.
- Plugins do not automatically communicate with the GDS unless they explicitly use shared resources such as the standard pipeline.
- Use `GdsStandardApp` for most use cases where GDS data is consumed in a standard way.

## Required Interface

There are two approaches to GDS App plugins.

## Option 1: Low-Level Interface (`GdsApp`)

To fully control how your plugin is launched, subclass the [`GdsApp`](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-gds/blob/devel/src/fprime_gds/executables/apps.py#L76) base class and implement the `get_process_invocation()` method. This lets you run any external process.

```python
from fprime_gds.executables.apps import GdsApp
from fprime_gds.plugin.definitions import gds_plugin

@gds_plugin(GdsApp)
class MyExternalProcessPlugin(GdsApp):
    """Launches a custom script in its own process."""

    def get_process_invocation(self) -> list[str]:
        return ["python3", "my_script.py", "--log=telemetry.txt"]
```

## Option 2: Recommended Interface (GdsStandardApp)

For most applications that want to interact with GDS data, subclassing [`GdsStandardApp`](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-gds/blob/devel/src/fprime_gds/executables/apps.py#L166) is recommended. This helper class handles:

- Wiring up the standard GDS data pipeline
- Parsing and forwarding common CLI arguments
- Invoking your applicationâ€™s `start()` method inside a proper runtime environment

Required Methods

You must implement:

    start(self, pipeline: StandardPipeline) -> None:
    Main logic of your application. Called after GDS is initialized and connected. Passed a StandardPipeline

You may optionally implement:

    init(self) -> None:
    Called before the pipeline is created. Useful for setting up internal state or environment configuration.

    get_additional_arguments(self) -> Dict[Tuple[str], Dict]:
    Return additional CLI arguments your app needs. These are injected into the GDS CLI parser.  It is a map of argument flags to Argparse add_argument keyword arguments.  These arguments are passed to the constructor.

Example

```python
from fprime_gds.executables.apps import GdsStandardApp
from fprime_gds.common.plugins import gds_plugin

@gds_plugin(GdsApp)
class MyCustomApp(GdsStandardApp):
    """ Custom application """

    def __init__(self, custom_rate, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.custom_rate = custom_rate

    def start(self, pipeline):
        print("App started: " + self.custom_rate)

    
    def get_additional_arguments(self):
        from argparse import ArgumentParser
        return {("--custom-rate",): {
            "type": int,
            "default": 10,
            "help": "Polling rate (Hz)"
        }
```

> [!NOTE]
> You do not need to implement get_process_invocation() when using GdsStandardApp. It is handled automatically.

### Example: Data Handlers

A process to run custom data handler plugins shows an example of a GdsStandardApp: [CustomDataHandlers](https://github.com/nasa/fprime-gds/blob/0b749b54b8ff8c6b5a379a6e0adb5acacc7a3d30/src/fprime_gds/executables/apps.py#L285-L323).  It uses `init` to set up the plugin system before parsing arguments, and uses `start` to attach data handlers to the standard pipeline.
