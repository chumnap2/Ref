# Fw::Buffer Serializable / Fw::BufferGet Port / Fw::BufferSend Port

## 1 Introduction

This module provides the following elements:

* A type `Fw::Buffer` representing a wrapper around a variable-size buffer. This allows for passing a reference to the
allocated memory around without a copy. Typically the memory is allocated in a buffer manager or similar component but
this is not required.
* A port `Fw::BufferGet` for requesting a buffer of type `Fw::Buffer` from
a [`BufferManager`](../../../Svc/BufferManager/docs/sdd.md) and similar components.

* A port `Fw::BufferSend` for sending a buffer of type `Fw::Buffer` from one component to another.

## 2 Design

The `Fw::Buffer` type wraps a pointer to memory and the size of that memory region. Thus, allowing users to pass the
pointer and size around as a pair without incurring a copy of the data at each step. **Note:** `Fw::Buffer` is not safe
to pass outside a given address space.

### 2.1 The Type Fw::Buffer

`Fw::Buffer` is a serializable class defining the following (private) fields. These fields are accessed through accessor functions.

Name | Type | Accessors | Purpose
---- | ---- | --------- | -------
`m_bufferData` | `U8*` | `getData()`/`setData()`       | Pointer to the raw memory wrapped by this buffer
`m_size`       | `U32` | `getSize()`/`setSize()`       | Size of the raw memory region wrapped by this buffer
`m_context`    | `U32` | `getContext()`/`setContext()` | Context of buffer's origin. Used to track buffers created by [`BufferManager`](../../../Svc/BufferManager/docs/sdd.md)

A value _B_ of type `Fw::Buffer` is **valid** if `m_bufferData != nullptr` and
`m_size > 0`; otherwise it is **invalid**.
The interface function `isValid` reports whether a buffer is valid.
Calling this function on a buffer _B_ returns `true` if _B_ is valid, otherwise `false`.

If a buffer _B_ is invalid, then the pointer returned by _B_ `.getData()` and the
serialization interfaces returned by
_B_ `.getSerializer()` and _B_ `.getDeserializer()` are considered invalid and should not be used.

### 2.2 The Port Fw::BufferGet

As shown in the following diagram, `Fw::BufferGet` has one argument `size` of type `U32`. It returns a value of type
`Fw::Buffer`. The returned `Fw::Buffer` must be checked for validity before using.

### 2.3 The Port Fw::BufferSend

As shown in the following diagram, `Fw::BufferSend` has one argument `fwBuffer` of type `Fw::Buffer`.

## 3 Usage Notes

Components allocating `Fw::Buffer` objects may use the `m_context` field at their discretion. This field is typically
used to track the origin of the buffer for eventual allocation.

When a component fails to allocate memory, it must set
the `m_bufferData` field to `nullptr` and/or set the `m_size` field to zero to indicate that the buffer is invalid.

A receiver of an `Fw::Buffer` object _B_ must check that _B_ is valid before accessing the
data stored in _B_.
To check validity, you can call the interface function `isValid()`.

### Serializing and Deserializing with `Fw::Buffer`

Users can obtain a serialization buffer, `sb`, by calling either `getSerializer()` or `getDeserializer()`. 
Note that both of these methods return a `Fw::ExternalSerializeBufferWithMemberCopy` object that is meant to be 
managed by the caller and only affects the data of the underlying buffer.

**Serializing to `Fw::Buffer`**
```c++
U32 my_data = 10001;
U8  my_byte = 2;
auto sb = my_fw_buffer.getSerializer();
sb.serializeFrom(my_data);
sb.serializeFrom(my_byte);
```

**Deserializing from `Fw::Buffer`**
```c++
U32 my_data = 0;
U8  my_byte = 0;
auto sb = my_fw_buffer.getDeserializer();
sb.deserializeTo(my_data);
sb.deserializeTo(my_byte);
```
